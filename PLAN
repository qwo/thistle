ONLY TWO FILES LEFT!

app.py:
is run once. serves index.html. uses acorn.py to manage docker instances.
manages rooms. redirects users to random URL if they visit "/".

index.html:
is delivered statically to users. beautifully displays other users' inputs
and outputs. contains JS which handles socketio. perhaps later some parts
broken off into room.js and room.css.


There is a plan,
the plan
is like this:

Docker instances run the Python shell
getting messages from the Flask app
through multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager
and pushing messages to the Flask app
through multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager
on port 5000 on Docker instance and
random
port on Docker host

OK

Now we have the users
when they go to blank URL
it just redirects
them
to a random URL
thistle.io/??????

This random URL represents
a room
the room, if new, fires up
a Docker instance
also, the user has join_room
called
within the
Tornado app

OK

Every time a user sends
some
message
that gets passed to everyone
else
in the
room.

Also the Tornado app
passes
that message
over to the Docker
instance.

OK

The Docker instances evaluates
the
message and
sends
the output:
back
to the room

OK

When there are no users
left in the
room
then Docker host sends
docker kill
:(
and also gets rid
of
manager
:-(

So now what's left

Nothing?

OK
